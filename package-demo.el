;;; Commentary:

;; Package Demo allows you to demonstrate package features in a
;; predictable way.  Think of it like a glorified keyboard macro that
;; runs at believably-human speeds.
;;
;; Example:
;;
;;     (package-demo-define-demo do-something
;;       (typewriter "Hello, world!")
;;       (pause 1)
;;       (typewriter "\nI'm package-demo.el!")
;;       (M-x #'save-buffer))
